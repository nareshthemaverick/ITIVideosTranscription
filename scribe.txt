To one and zero to root Y-X-Y into Dy DX Solution given that I is equal to the double integral zero to one and zero to root Y-X-Y into integrating equation one with respect to X.

00:00:21.350 - Speaker 1
We get by applying the limits for X and Simplifying. We get this implies I is equal to one by two into integral of zero to one y square into Dy.
